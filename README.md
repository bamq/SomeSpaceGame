## SomeSpaceGame
This isn't really about the game, but learning how to use Love2D and make some interesting things with Lua that I have never done before.

If you really want to know more about the game, here it goes:
- It's a simple game where you fly a spaceship around and shoot enemies.
- Enemies spawn randomly in the top quarter of the screen.
- Shoot the enemies to gain score. If an enemy shoots you, you lose a life.
- Controls: W, A, S, D, arrow keys: move around. Space: Shoot. Escape: Pause. Z: toggle show score. C: toggle show FPS. Left shift: boost. Tab: Restart game.

And that's pretty much it. It's a boring game, but I'm just using it to learn.
